# Proof for LCM * GCD = |ab|
Let a = gm and b = gn, where g = gcd{a,b} and m and n are coprime.  
> coprime numbers have gcd = 1   

The existence of m and n are proved by Integers Divided by GCD are Coprime.  
Since a = gm \ gmn and b = gn \ gmn, gmn is the LCM of a and b.  

Then it follows that lcm{a,b} X gcd{a,b} = gmn X g = gm X gn = |ab|
